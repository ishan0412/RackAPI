# Rack
This project implements a REST API for collecting, viewing, and searching through clothing products sold online, keeping information on these products -- such as their names, prices, and retailers -- in a database. 
## Upcoming Work
- Querying methods incorporating more complex filters (e.g., only retrieving products on sale, products from a certain retailer, etc.)
- A web scraping script scheduled to routinely aggregate clothing products from popular retailers and enter them into the database.
